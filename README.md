<h3> This project tries to showcase the various factors that can potencially affect the chances of a student getting placed on-campus.Some of the questions that can be asked are as follows : </h3> <br>

* Does percentage play a major role in placements?
* Which particular degree specialization is much demanded by corporates?
* Which Board(either Central or State) have higher chances of getting placed?

 <h3> All these questions among others have been answered in this project using various EDA techniques and visualization techniques. </h3> 
 <h3> Besides, examining all these factors, I have also built an ML model using Logistic Regression to predict the chances of a particular student getting place providing all the necessary information as input. The model gave an accuracy of about 91%. </h3>
